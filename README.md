# Instagram Account Real vs Fake Prediction

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project uses **Machine Learning** to predict whether an Instagram account is **real** or **fake** based on various profile features such as follower count, following count, post count, privacy status, and username similarity.

The classification model is built using **Python** and **scikit-learn**, with exploratory data analysis performed using **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- **Source**: train.csv,
              test.csv
- **Features**:
  - #followers â€“ Number of followers
  - #follows â€“ Number of accounts followed
  - #posts â€“ Number of posts
  - private â€“ Whether the account is private (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
  - name==username â€“ Whether the display name matches the username (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
  - **Target**: fake â€“ 1 = Fake account, 0 = Real account

## ðŸš€ Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**
   - Removed duplicates
   - Checked for missing values
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Distribution plots for features
   - Correlation heatmap
   - Boxplots and scatter plots
3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Encoded categorical features
4. **Model Building**
   - Used RandomForestClassifier
   - Train-test split for model evaluation
5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
- **Model**: RandomForestClassifier
- **Performance**: Achieved high accuracy in classifying accounts as real or fake.
- **Key Insights**:
  - Fake accounts often have unusually high following-to-follower ratios.
  - Accounts with name==username = 1 tend to be more genuine.

## ðŸ“· Sample Visualizations
- Correlation heatmap of features
- Boxplots showing distribution of followers, follows, and posts
- Pie charts of account type distribution

---

## ðŸ”® Future Improvements
- Experiment with more models (XGBoost, Logistic Regression, etc.)
- Apply hyperparameter tuning
- Collect more diverse Instagram account data
- Deploy model as a web app
